            <h1>Observation</h1>
            <p>Initially, reviewing my daily life, I was wondering about the connection between the
            space and myself.
            <br/>Personally speaking, as a person who lives in cities for my whole life, I cannot tell
            if I prefer or dislike the lives in cities. I just use to this way of living. Because living
            in busy cities, I seldom look into things that happen around me and think about the
            meaning of them.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>In this light, I start to observe and take pictures of my daily

                daily life.</p>
